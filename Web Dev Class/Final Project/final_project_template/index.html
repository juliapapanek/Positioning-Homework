            <h2>Meet Julia</h2>
            <img src="img/Julia.jpg">
            <p>Hello and welcome to Plants and the Pacific! This blog is where I share my edible creations made with all plant-based ingredients. I will show you how delicious, simple, and nurturing plant-based food can be and how amazing it can make you feel inside and out.</p>
            <p>When I was eight years old, I decided to become a vegetarian after learning about how animals are mistreated on factory farms. As the only vegetarian in my family, I began experimenting in the kitchen to create meat-free meals and discovered my love for cooking.</p>
            <p>A few years ago, I traveled to India and was impacted by the culture and my interaction with animals there. I commonly came across cows and chickens when I was out exploring, which you rarely get a chance to interact with at home. It's easy to turn a blind eye to the harm these animals experience to produce dairy and eggs, but being face-to-face with them brought to light how similar they are to the pets we care for at home. When I returned from this trip, I began experimenting with a plant-based diet and found that it not only made me feel good physically, but also mentally knowing the positive impact I was having for animals and the planet.</p>
            <p>I hope that whether you follow a plant-based diet or are just looking for some simple, tasty recipes, you will follow along as I learn and discover new things about plant-based cooking. I’m so excited to share my recipes, photos, and inspiration with you and hope to hear from you as well.</p>
